		\textbf{Dear SafeAD's Recruitment team,}\\~\\
		In hope of gaining more practical experience, I am writing to express my ambition in pursuing the Software Engineer position for Autonomous Driving at SafeAD. I believe that my experience and background make me a potential candidate.\\~\\
		Concerning my background, my bachelor's degree was in Control Engineering and Automation. Ending the robotics-related thesis left me with even greater ambition and desire to continue exploring the field. I carried on my master’s degree in Robotic Systems Engineering at RWTH Aachen University. During the time, I paid unparalleled effort and excelled in courses in Machine Learning and Computer Visions. Moreover, I managed to gain hand-on programming experiences in Python using various libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.). Till the end, I am ranked in the top 5\% students, in terms of academic achievements, and have received the Best of Class Awards with scholarships twice.\\~\\
		Sharpening practical skills, to me, is just as important as having a solid theoretical background. For the last semester of my master’s degree, determined to gain more experience, I conducted both the thesis and internship at Robert Bosch GmbH. During this period, I have striven to make the most out of my time to learn from my supportive supervisors and their talented colleagues. I familiarized myself with different technical tools (ROS, Linux), coding languages (Python, C++, Bash, CMake) and workflow of professional robotic developers (git, Jira).\\~\\
		One major lesson that I learn after the master's degree is that there are still certain gaps between theoretical research and real life applications. It is challenging to create meaningful products and improve theirs performance. Autonomous driving, without doubt, carries a purposeful vision. It is inter-disciplinary, which makes it challenging, yet appealing. I would love to be a part of the team and make contribution to this field, while also continue to learn and honing my skills.\\~\\
		Getting to know me, you will find a student who is open-minded, adaptive and eager to learn. I believe that I can be a strong contributor to your engineering team.\\~\\
		Best regards,\\
		Huu Duc Nguyen
